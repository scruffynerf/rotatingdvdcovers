This userscript requires Tampermonkey, ViolentMonkey, etc... 

It adds 'spinning dvd covers' to the Movie/Groups section of Stash.

Features:  Can be set to either Autospin or spin only on Hover.
Autospin will pause if you hover... you can make dvds rotate at different intervals this way.
Autospin=false will rotate only on hover, and allow you to turn the dvd 'case' over (and leave it there if you stop hovering)

I really wanted Spinning DVD covers, and adding it to Jellyfin, etc seems impossible but this works well for Stash.

Plus now I have a real reason to track down more back covers.

Yes, you need glasses... you might be going blind.  We know why.
